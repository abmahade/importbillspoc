1.	Currently, the google vision API does not support TIF. Is there a plan to support this in the near future?
2.	Scratches on image or tick marks are not handled well.
3.	Circular text is not handled well.
4.	Overlaid text is not handled well. But if we remove the overlays, the OCR works better.
5.	Is there any difference in functionality between the HTTP calls, the API and the browser based upload and scan functionality?
6.	Is there a way we can pass on parameters to the vision call api to indicate that an image contains certain things like scratches?
7.	Can we indicate to google api that it should process only part of an image?
